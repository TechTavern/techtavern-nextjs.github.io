The UN's new report on "[Governing AI for Humanity](https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/governing_ai_for_humanity_final_report_en.pdf)" is a wake-up call we can't ignore. As someone with 30 years of experience in evolving information systems for large-scale international efforts, here's why I believe this matters to every one of us:

AI is the most transformative technology of my lifetime, with the potential to catapult humanity towards unprecedented prosperity or unfathomable risk. Its rapid emergence has left even experts racing to comprehend its global implications.

The UN report rightly emphasizes the crucial importance of ensuring the benefits of AI are shared by all of humanity. AI, built on our collective human knowledge, must return value to humanity. We are all shareholders in AI's development, and like any shareholders, we deserve both ethical practices and a return on our investment.

The real game-changer in delivering these benefits globally? AI's ability to scale complexity and personalize solutions. Imagine a world where instead of one-size-fits-all approaches, we have AI agents tackling individual critical problems at a global scale. At Data Friendly Space, we're already exploring this through our work on our Humanitarian Assistant \- [GANNET](https://gannet.ai/), our development of individualized AI analytics frameworks, and our collaboration with non-profit partners to incorporate AI considerations in their strategic planning and data governance.

The UN report outlines seven key recommendations, from coordinating standards to building global capacity. These provide a vital roadmap for nations grappling with AI's challenges.

However, we face conflicting concerns that include:

* The dangers of deploying technologies too complex for humans to understand and govern.  
* Innovation stifling through premature regulation.  
* Dangers of the rise of tech-oligarchies.  
* Concerns about the pitfalls of centralized control.

The questions of how to govern AI are complex and difficult. In the US State of California, the assembly proposed a bill that would make creators of AI liable for any damages resulting from the use of their systems by third parties. This reflects the growing cultural anxiety over AI and how strongly voices are driving AI policy. Thankfully, this bill was [vetoed by the Governor of California](https://www.axios.com/2024/09/30/california-ai-safety-bill-governor-newsom-veto) as, ultimately, it was more an emotional response than a thoughtful policy decision. We have a very challenging road ahead in managing our fear while dedicating the time needed to develop thoughtful, ethical AI governance. We should also be careful in how we structure governance to ensure the widest possible participation and input from all stakeholders \- not just governments, industry, and academia, but from everyone. AI is a global technology, and we need a global response.

Now is the time for difficult conversations and thoughtful engagement. At Data Friendly Space, we're committed to this dialogue, developing AI solutions that prioritize global benefit and ethical governance. Our recent collaboration with NESTA to develop AI safety training in the [Community Crisis Intelligence course](https://kayaconnect.org/course/info.php?id=9112) at kaya.com demonstrates this commitment in action.

The UN's Pact for the Future and their approach to global AI governance echo successful international agreements like the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. By fostering global engagement and focusing on shared risks and benefits, we can craft effective AI governance.

What's your take on the UN report? How is your organization preparing for an AI-driven future? Let's continue this crucial conversation together.
