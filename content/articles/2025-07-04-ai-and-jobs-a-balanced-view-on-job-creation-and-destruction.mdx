Not long ago, Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, warned that AI could [eliminate](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/ai-jobs-white-collar-unemployment-anthropic) up to 50% of white-collar jobs within five years. Understandably, this has stirred anxiety and fueled discussions around universal basic income. It's no surprise, especially when headlines use terms like "bloodbath" to describe the situation.

I don't claim to predict the future of AI, but neither do the doomers or the optimists. However, it's worth examining the straightforward economic logic suggesting that AI might create more jobs than it displaces.

As AI enhances individual productivity, operational costs decrease. Lower costs make it easier to start new businesses, and higher productivity increases returns on investment. This environment encourages the formation of new businesses or nonprofits.

Consider a business with 10 employees. If AI enables the them to operate with 5 employees at double the productivity, it might cut 5 positions. However, the reduced costs and increased efficiency could lead to the creation of two new businesses, each employing 5 people. Now, instead of one firm with 10 employees, there are three firms with a total of 15 employeesâ€”a net gain of 5 jobs.

This concept aligns with Schumpeter's theory of "[creative destruction](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creativedestruction.asp)," where innovation disrupts existing industries but also fosters new opportunities.

Without doubt, there will be significant disruption and painful transition. The pace alone is likely to be difficult and chaotic for many of us, and the benefits of emerging opportunities may be unevenly distributed. It's not my intention to dismiss any of that, but given the volume of doomer articles, I thought it could be helpful to at least remind ourselves that it's not guaranteed to be all doom and gloom. Understanding these dynamics can provide a more balanced perspective amidst prevalent job loss narratives.

How do you perceive AI's impact on employment in your industry?
